# e-commerce-with-nuxt-and-node

I made this project while learning nuxt.js. An .env file must be created in the "/server" directory.<br>

## Must contain .env file

> DATABASE = <br>
> SECRET_KEY =

## Build Setup
<p>
Run the following bash command in each directory to install the packages.
<p>

```bash
# install dependencies
$ npm install
```

<p>
 Run "/client" and "/admin" app. <br>
 These are nuxt.js applications.
<p>

```bash
# serve with hot reload for client at localhost:3000
# serve with hot reload for admin at localhost:3001
$ npm run dev
```

<p>
 Run "/server" app. <br>
 These are node.js applications.
<p>

```bash
# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
$ nodemon server
```
